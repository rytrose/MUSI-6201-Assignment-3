function [f0, timeInSec] = myPitchTrackMod2(x, blockSize, hopSize, fs)

%% Blockwise Pitch Tracking based on a modified approach
% Input:
%   x:          (N x 1) float vector, input signal
%   blockSize:  int, block size of the blockwise process
%   hopSize:    int, hop size of the blockwise process
%   fs:         float, sample rate in Hz
% Output:
%   f0:         (numBlocks x 1) float vector, detected pitch (Hz) per block
%   timeInSec:  (numBlocks x 1) float vector, time stamp (sec) of each block
